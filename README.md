 ## Hi 👋 I am Mrigesh Deshpande! 
 
 Hi, i'm Mrigesh Deshpande, a passionate self-taught full stack web developer and a freelance software engineer from India.
 I have been working with both backend and full stack frameworks, I have also built my own projects using MER(A)N, Python, and Java.
 
 My enthusiasm for software stems from conceiving up concepts and making them a reality via efficient user experience, 
 which lead me to write research papers on NLP and automation.
 I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I learned a lot from the open-source community and love contributing.



💼 any freelance work? do reach, email :)
